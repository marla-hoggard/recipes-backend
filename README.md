# Recipes API - Postgres Implmementation

This branch represents the original implementation of my Recipes API, as implemented in 2020. It was written in JavaSsript with a PostGresQL database and knex.js. In 2025, I rewrote the API using MongoDB and TypeScript, but am maintaining this branch as a reference to the original postgres implemenation.

This repo uses `yarn` along with `nodemon` for starting the server and hot reloading. To run the API, simple run `yarn start`.

**Note:** Must be running Node v12 or higher.
